Source code for my server-client file transferring Python scripts.

## Code Structure
Server part is located in `server.py`, client part is in `client.py`. `client.py` is meant to be run from the console with the following structure:
```
python3 client.py <FILENAME> <SERVER_ADDRESS> <SERVER_PORT>
```
Server is running on port 8800. The address it's currently running on can be found at:
```
3.15.32.117
```
## Running the code
Before running any of the scripts, run 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

to install the necessary dependencies.
